I don't understand why the latest version of Marlin firmware
(2.1) is so different from previous versions.
What was wrong with it!?  It was working fine for me!
Unfortunately I was forced to renew my motherboard recently 
and opted for the Big Tree Tech SKR 3 in combination with
the BTT TFT32 v3 display.  Which I have to say, considering that
both products are from the same company they are far from easy to
combine.  (very little documentation.  And an incorrect instruction
for plugging in!). I was forced to try to adopt the latest version of Marlin
as it seems to be the only one which has files supporting my
STM32H723 motherboard chip.  Why on earth change things seemingly
for no good reason all the time?!
